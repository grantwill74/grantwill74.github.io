# About Me

I am an applied data scientist and software engineer working at Microsoft. I received my Ph.D. from Louisiana State University, where I worked with [Nash Mahmoud](http://csc.lsu.edu/~mahmoud/) at [SEEL â€” the Software Engineering and Evolution Lab at LSU](http://seel.cse.lsu.edu/).

My research focuses were Requirements Engineering and mining software repositories. In my research I tackle problems related to analyzing and synthesizing user feedback available on app store and on social media outlets to enable a more responsive software engineering process. I applied natural language processing and machine learning techniques to do this.
